# Programming for Social Scientists Portfolio

This portfolio contains all work completed during the week long course in Leeds for 'Programming for Social Scientists.' 
The portfolio is to be assessed for 30% of the module mark, and the brief was:
  - The portfolio should comprise a **website** of one or more pages
  - The website should including **biographical material** explaining who you are
  - There should be some details of the **model**, 
  - The **code** for the model(s) should be included

  ## Introduction to Agent-based modelling
  
  Include some info about ABM, why it is important, what it has been used for etc.

  ## Structure of the Repository
  
  This *repository* contains all of the practical scripts and a selection of relevant outputs from each of practical sessions in Leeds.
  In this next section i will outline all the learning outcomes from each practical, before introducing the final model.

  ### Practical One - Introducing Agent-Based Modelling
  
  In this practical session, the following learning outcomes were achieved:
    1) Created two agents, each with their own unique x and y coordinates
    2) Moved each agent according to a randomly generated number
    3) Calculated the distance between the two agents (x and y), using pythagoras' theorem
    
  The **code** for this practical session can be found at: *include hyperlink*
  
  As detailed in the code, there were a number of problems with the code at this point:
    * Lots of repetition, when generating and moving agents
    * No behaviour other than movement, so doesn't really feel very agent-based
    * Area for agents to move about is currently infinite, which is neither practical or realistic
    * Distance calculations are very boring, when the agent starting positions are the same

   ### Practical Two - Shrinking Code
   
   In this practical a number of learning outcomes were achieved:
    1) Learned how to append the agents to a list, generating their x and y coordinates randomly this time
    2) Learned how to use the max() operation to calculate the agent with the largest x coordinate
    3) Learned how to plot our two agents using matplotlib.pyplot
    
   The **code** for this practical session can be found at: *include hyperlink*
   
   The main outcome of this practical session was that not only was it possible to calculate the agent with the largest 'x' coordinate,
   but it was also possible to plot this calculation.
   The agent with the largest 'x' coordinate can be seen plotted in red in: *include hyperlink*
